# Clean Slave

I abuse my computer: constantly installing things, never really cleaning up, failing
to remember to repair disc permissions. I treat it like the slave it is.

On occasion, I treat the bleep blop machine to a nice cleaning - by wiping it entirely.
On such an occastion, this repo provides a simple way to get back to basics in terms
of the apps and scripts I need for development.

If this helps you, cool. If not, whatever. It's not your computer anyhow.
